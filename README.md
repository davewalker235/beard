Beard Template Library
=====

I've been wanting to develop a template language in the spirit of Haml and Mustache for some time. Seemed like good excuse to mess around with leex and yeec. This isn't quite working, but it's on it's way.

Goals
=====
* Mustache style variables and loops
* HTML style tags for ease of recognition
* Indent based automatic tag closing
* Abstract Syntax tree for extracting and modifying elements (custom elements)
* Possibly integration with PostCSS to rewrite and minify classes
